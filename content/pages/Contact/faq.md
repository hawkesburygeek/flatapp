## What's News?

#### Q: Where can I find the latest (and greatest) Jekyll news and goodies?

Check the official Jekyll news blog (web: [jekyllrb.com/news](http://jekyllrb.com/news)) 
or the Twitter page (t: [jekyllrb](https://twitter.com/jekyllrb)).

For detailed upcoming major and minor enhancements and bug fixes, see the [History page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/History.markdown) in the Jekyll repo.

For more Jekyll news see the Static Times news channel (t: [statictimes](https://twitter.com/statictimes)).

For more Jekyll goodies see the [Awesome Jekyll](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll) bookmark list or the [Jekyll bookmark category](http://www.thenewdynamic.org/tool/jekyll/) at the (Static is) The New Dynamic site.


## Themes / Templates

#### Q: Where can I find themes?

Check the [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/) directory or

See the [Themes wiki page](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Themes) at the Jekyll repo site or

Search Goolge for [jekyll themes](http://google.com/?q=jekyll+themes) 


#### Q: Can I use Bootstrap with Jekyll?

Yes, of course. You can use any HTML starter template/boilerplate with Jekyll.

Jekyll (and GitHub Pages) has built-in support for SCSS, thus, if you use the Bootstrap SCSS version - Jekyll
will auto-build the `bootstrap.css` from the sources letting you change colors,  fonts and much more
in `_settings.scss`.
To get started see the `jekyll-bootstrap-theme` (github: [henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme)) - a ready-to-fork starter theme - as a (live) example.


#### Q: How can I get started with gem-packaged themes? / Do I need to package my theme into a gem?

Gem-packaged themes are just an advanced option and in addition they are in development 
for (real world) experiments (e.g. think v0.1 as stated by the Ben Balter - the lead designer / manager / dev at GitHub).

Thus, to conclude do NOT read too much into the official themes docs e.g. as the only or "right" way to design a theme. 
Just (continue to) use "classic" themes - there are hundreds to learn from and once you have mastered "classic" themes 
you can "graduate" to the master class, that is, using gem-packaged themes.

Again gem-packaged themes are wonderful and welcome -- remember, however, the party is just getting started:

- [henrythemes/hello-minima-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/hello-minima-theme)

For some "classic" starter themes you may try some of Henry's themes:

- [henrythemes/hello-jekyll-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/hello-jekyll-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme-v2](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-starter-theme-v2)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-minimal-theme)
- [henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme](https://github.com/henrythemes/jekyll-bootstrap-theme)

For the "state-of-art" what a "classic" theme can do - see the incredible beautiful and 
extremely well-documented (incl. a getting started guide and much much more) [Minimal Mikstake (MM) theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by Michael Rose. Happy Jekylling.


#### Q: Where can I find gem-packaged themes?

See the [Awesome (Gem-Packaged) Jekyll themes page](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-themes) 


## Getting Help 


#### Q: Where can I find help?

Use the official Jekyll talk forum (web: [talk.jekyllrb.org](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/)) 
to post your questions and find help on troubleshooting.

Ask your (Jekyll) friends!

For GitHub Pages see the [GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Help Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-troubleshooting/)
for a start. 


#### Q: Where can I find Jekyll friends?

Look for a Jekyll (static site) user group in your city.

In Europe groups include:

- @ Vienna, Austria - **Vienna.html** (t: [viennahtml](https://twitter.com/viennahtml))

In America groups include:

- @ New York, New York - **The New Dynamic** (meetup: [The-New-Dynamic](http://meetup.com/The-New-Dynamic/))

If there's no Jekyll group yet in your city, why not start one! 
If not, try a local Ruby user group (be aware you might run into some Middleman fanatics ;-),
see the [Awesome Events Page @ Planet Ruby](https://github.com/planetruby/awesome-events) for a world-wide listing.  


## Troubleshooting

#### Q: The Markdown page (e.g. `welcome.md`) gets copied 1:1 to the `_site` folder without getting converted to HTML? Why?

Double check your front matter. Jekyll REQUIRES that your markdown page starts with a front matter section e.g.:

```
---
layout: page
title:  The Front Matters
---
```

Note: The front matter MUST start and end with three dashes e.g. `---` (not two `--` or four `----` etc.). As a rule: Without front matter there's no preprocessing, that is, conversion from Markdown (`.md`) to Markup (`.html`).


#### Q: Why are my page headings (e.g. `##Heading`) not rendered any longer?

Note: Most markdown converter REQUIRE a space between `##` and `Heading`, thus, change:

```
#Heading One
##Heading Two
```

to

```
# Heading One
## Heading Two
```

#### Q: Jekyll doesn't render Markdown when adding HTML tags?

Note: If you put your markdown inside an HTML block tag (e.g. `div`) - the default setting for Jekyll's markdown converter (e.g. kramdown) 
is to pass the text along as is, that is, without any conversion. Example:

```
<div>
A List:

- Apples
- Oranges
- Blueberries
</div>
```

Use the "magic" markdown attribute to turn on markdown conversion inside an HTML block tag e.g.:

```
<div markdown="1">
A List:

- Apples
- Oranges
- Blueberries
</div>
```

### Posts and Pages

#### Q: Why are my latest posts not output (when using a `site.posts` loop)?

Note: By default future posts will not get added to the posts collection. To get future posts added use the
`future: true` setting in `_config.yml`. For example, lets assume today is 2016-10-12.

```
_posts/
  2016-07-11-new-beerdb-maps.md
  2016-08-12-new-footballdb-build-system.md
  2017-01-25-new-season.md
   
```  

Than the posts collection above (without `future: true`) will NOT 
include the `2017-01-25-new-season.md` post in `site.posts`.


#### Q: How can I include markdown blocks in markdown pages?

You can include markdown blocks from files in your markdown pages with `include` (looks in the `_includes` folder) or
`include_relative` (looks in the current folder of your page). 

Example `article.md`:

```
---
title:  Title 
layout: default
---

{% include_relative intro.md %}
{% include_relative explanation.md %}
{% include_relative conclusion.md %}

```

Note: With `include_relative` you can only include files from 
the current folder and its subfolders but NOT up the hierachy in parent folders e.g. `..\` 
due to the security sandbox.


#### Q: How can I include markdown blocks in html pages?

If your page is a HTML page e.g. `about.html` 
you have to capture the included markdown block  
and than convert the markdown block with the `markdownify` filter. 

Example `about.html`:

```
{% capture intro %}{% include intro.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ intro | markdownify }}
```


## Syntax Highlighting

#### Q: How can I get backtick fenced code blocks (e.g. \`\`\`) working (with kramdown)?

Use the GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) parser / mode. Change your `_config.yml` settings to:

```
markdown: kramdown
 
kramdown:
  input: GFM
  hard_wrap: false
```

For more see the Official [GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) Docu Page](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/gfm.html).


### Q: How can I get backtick fenced code blocks (e.g. \`\`\`) working inside lists (with kramdown)?

The gist is that the indentation for the code block in lists is determined
by the column number of the first non-space character after the list item marker. Huh? 

Let's use some examples (note the leading spaces get replaced with dots e.g. `·` to help along):

_Bulleted List_


    *·some text     =>  use 2 spaces indentation e.g.
    
      ```
      $ gem install beerdb
      ```

    *···some text   =>  use 4 spaces indentation e.g.
    
        ```
        $ gem install beerdb
        ```


_Numbered List_

    1.·some text    =>  use 3 spaces indentation e.g.
    
       ```
       $ gem install beerdb
       ```

**==> If you line up the fenced code block with the "natural" list indentation, it will work.**


For more examples, see the [syntax highlighter sandbox list page](http://planetjekyll.github.io/sandbox-syntax-highlighter/lists.html) - [(source)](https://github.com/planetjekyll/sandbox-syntax-highlighter/blob/gh-pages/lists.md).



#### Q: How can I turn on syntax highlighting in code blocks (with kramdown 'n' rouge)?

Use the `highlighter` and the `kramdown.syntax_highlighter` options. Change your `_config.yml` settings to:

```
highlighter: rouge

markdown: kramdown

kramdown:
  input: GFM
  hard_wrap: false
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
```


#### Q: How can I turn off syntax highlighting in code blocks (with kramdown 'n' rouge)?

Use the `kramdown.syntax_highlighter_opts.disable` option. Change your `_config.yml` settings to:

```
highlighter: rouge

markdown: kramdown

kramdown:
  input: GFM
  hard_wrap: false
  syntax_highlighter: rouge
  syntax_highlighter_opts:
    disable: true
```

For more see the Official [Rouge Syntax Highlighter Docu Page](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax_highlighter/rouge.html).


#### Q: How can I add a CSS syntax highlighter theme for Rouge?

Note: If you have Rouge configured Jekyll will only highlight / markup your code in
HTML documents using css classes.

e.g.


    ```c
    printf("Hello, World!");
    ```

becomes:


``` html
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

```

As step two you have to add css styles to your site's css folder. You can use the
rouge command line tool called `rougify` to get a copy of your theme.
For example, to save the css styles for the monokai.sublime theme 
to the file `syntax.css` try:


```
$ rougify style monokai.sublime > syntax.css 
```

Finally as step three make sure you include / load the css styles for the syntax highlighter in your HTML template e.g.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/syntax.css">
```
That's it.

Tip: Looking for more themes?  Rouge aims to be a drop-in replacement for pygments (e.g. uses the same css style classes), 
thus, you can (re)use all pygments css themes.

## Liquid Templates

#### Q: How can I post (escape) code snippets that include curly brackets `{{ }}`?

Wrap your code snippets with `{% raw %}`..`{% endraw %}` tags. Example:

Before:

```liquid
{% assign words = content | number_of_words %}
{% if words < 360 %}
   1 min
{% else %}
   {{ words | divided_by:180 }} mins
{% endif %}
```

After:  

```liquid
{% raw %}
{% assign words = content | number_of_words %}
{% if words < 360 %}
    1 min
{% else %}
   {{ words | divided_by:180 }} mins
{% endif %}
{% endraw %}
```

Note: Unless escaped (with raw) `{{ }}` and `{% %}` get processed by Jekyll 
as Liquid template tags/directives/macros.



## History / Trivia

#### Q: Why is the Jekyll static site generator called Jekyll (and not Hyde or [your name here])?

Tom Preston-Werner started to put together some Ruby scripts that let you
"[Blog Like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)" back in 2008
and published the package as Jekyll with 
the tagline "Transform your text into a monster" and a black and white theme. 

The name is inspired by "[The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/jekyll-book-theme/)" - a novella written by 
Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson first published in 1886 in London. 
Why? Read the novella online - generated using the Jekyll world classics book theme ;-) 
Spoiler alert:  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is one and only one person.
